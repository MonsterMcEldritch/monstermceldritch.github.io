            Hi!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm Youssef, an aspiring varietymaxxer. I try to introduce myself and log some of my opinions and thoughts
            through this website both so that I may reach people I'd enjoy talking to and so that I may have easy access
            to
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to do things I find cool or interesting, and what is new usually
            falls under that descriptor. This is a very broad pursuit, but I don't think I can narrow it down any
            further,
            currently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some things I want to do (in no particular order):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Travel the world, not settling for tourist traps but getting a taste of all the lives I'm ignorant of,
                all
                the people who've led comically different lives to mine, all the places of beauty--whether that beauty
                be
                ostentatious or reserved.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Experience all the art worth experiencing. This is practically impossible, but the pursuit is what
                matters.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Write a work or create a game I can be genuinely proud of. Though I appreciate all artistic mediums
                roughly
                equally, the two I'm currently most drawn to creating are written prose and video games.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Become a polymath. I've always been very drawn to the idea of a jack-of-all-trades, and I hope to some
                day
                embody that.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Beyond just knowledge, I want to try <em>all</em> the hobbies, from skateboarding to knitting to Go to
                TTRPGs to HEMA. All of it.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meet and befriend more people.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Become jacked, such that my physical frame might evoke images of a gorilla (okay, maybe not
                <em>that</em>
                jacked).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Find love and thus figure out what all the hype is about.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I am not realizing these desires as well as I could be, but I try to continuously better myself in that and
            many
            other regards. Which leads me to another part of myself: my beliefs. One thing I earnestly believe in is the
            capacity people have to improve themselves. Most appeals to lack of talent or some other inborn factor are,
            I claim,
            comforting excuses people make so they may be at peace with their present inability and save themselves the
            effort
            and struggle of improving. I don't deny that some people improve more easily at certain things, but I do not
            consider
            that a valid reason to give up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some more beliefs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I am a devout Muslim.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Most things are acquired tastes. Some things you simply acquired the taste for as a child. This is
                mainly a
                response to the dislike of certain genres of music (noise and industrial genres, for one) or certain
                artistic mediums (comics and animation).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Social anxiety is holding all of us back even more than we realize. The possible benefits to just
                getting
                to know people we walk past daily and ignore are significant.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                People are generally good and well-meaning. It is at times difficult to maintain this belief but the
                good
                I've been exposed to still far outweighs the bad. Of course, the fact that I can believe this is a
                product
                of my experiences with people. Others' experiences might lead them to the opposite conclusion.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Intellectual property is bad. Almost all of it, despite its necessity for creatives to make money. I
                don't
                think it's reprehensible for one to have strict copyright of their intellectual property, due to the
                near
                necessity of such an act for life as a full-time creative. However, I personally think knowledge and art
                should not be locked behind barriers of wealth or any other thing. The monetization model I'm most
                inclined to
                for art is Pay What You Want, as with Itch.io games. Anything I ever create will be monetized with that
                model, if at all.
                In case it isn't already obvious, I believe piracy is based, excepting the case where you're capable of
                paying and are pirating
                a work made by indie or solo creators with no intention of paying.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Most people are letting mental blocks they might not even be cognizant of stop them from doing things
                they would like to do.
                I know <em>I</em> was and perhaps continue to be one such person.
            </li>

                Education systems globally, generally, are absolutely terrible. For one, I think highschool math
                education as it is currently present
                in all curriculums I'm acquainted in should not be compulsory. For more about the topic of math
                eduation, read <em> A Mathematician's Lament</em>.
