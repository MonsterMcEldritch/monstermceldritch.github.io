This website is a work in progress, still have a lot of things I want to do with it. My main purposes with it are to store some things I want to keep for myself, such as reviews of games or books I've enjoyed, but also to help me meet people who I might enjoy talking to. Plus, it's a good project to relearn frontend web dev after years of not making any websites.
